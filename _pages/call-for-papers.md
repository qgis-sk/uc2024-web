### Talks

A regular talk slot is 30 minutes long:

<p>

Workshops are the practical hands-on sessions to acquire new know-how in the use of software. They should showcase current and emerging technologies, and provide a direct interaction between our highly skilled community members and the public at large who want to learn something new or consolidate their skills.
</p><p>
Workshop slots are either <b>1:30 or 3:00 hours</b> long (the length can be chosen when submitting proposals) and they take place during the main conference, in parallel with other talks. We expect workshop participants to bring their own laptops.
</p><p>
When submitting a workshop, please use the abstract to make the scope and contents clear. Inclusion of a list of topics you want to cover is very welcome. Ideally, you should also list the prerequisite skills e.g. basic skills in Python programming are required. Also, please indicate if prior installation of any specific software is required.
