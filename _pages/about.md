### QGIS User Conference 2024

The conference includes a variety of presentations, workshops, and discussions on a wide range of QGIS topics.
Presentations cover topics such as:

- Interesting use cases of QGIS
- Advanced workflows with QGIS
- Deep dives into new QGIS features
- QGIS ecosystem (third party plugins, server solutions, mobile apps)
- Using QGIS for specific applications
- Integration of QGIS with other geospatial products
- Future plans for QGIS project

Workshops provide hands-on experience with specific QGIS tools and techniques - both for beginners and advanced users.

The program for this year will be available in May, but you can find some examples of what to expect at the <a href="https://uc2023.qgis.nl/">QGIS User Conference 2023 website</a>.

### Contributor Meeting

Right after the conference, <b>QGIS Contributor Meeting</b> will take place on <b>11-13 September</b> at the same venue. This event is for those who contribute to the development of QGIS. It's free to join but you are expected to make yourself useful on improving the QGIS application, documentation or website or do anything else QGIS will benefit from. See <a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/27th%E2%80%90Contributor%E2%80%90Meeting%E2%80%90in%E2%80%90Bratislava">Contributor Meeting details</a> on GitHub.


### Local Committee

- Technical Leaders
- Private Companies
- National and International Organizations, both Governmental and NGO
- Teachers and Education Professionals
- Scientific Communities and Researchers

and the talks cover mainly this topics:

- Software status, new software/project development, benchmarking
- FOSS4G implementations in strategic application domains: land management, crisis/disaster response, smart cities, population mapping, climate change, ocean and marine monitoring, etc.
- Data visualization: spatial analysis, manipulation and visualization of geospatial data
- Data collection, data sharing, data science, open data, big data, data exploitation platforms
- Sensors, remote sensing, laser-scanning, structure from motion
- New trends: IoT, Indoor mapping, drones - UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle)-, Artificial intelligence - machine learning, deep learning-, geospatial data structures
- Open and reproducible science
- Standards, interoperability, SDIs
- Community & participatory FOSS4G
- FOSS4G at governmental institutions
- FOSS4G in education
- Business products powered by FOSS4G

#### Our Vision

We are living in difficult times and the role of FOSS is essential for the sustainability and development of many day to day activities. From simple family communication to the development of new platforms for education and geoscience, FOSS today is the key to success.

#### Innovation

We understand and cherish the importance of FOSS4G for giving voice to the daring new ideas and developments in perfect harmony with the pillars of what open source for geospatial is, and thus we promise workshops, talks and keynotes that will provoke your mind and give you hope for a better future.

### OSGeo

The Open Source Geospatial Foundation was founded to support and build the highest-quality open source geospatial software. The foundation's goal is to encourage the use and collaborative development of community-led projects, data development and education. Many projects live under the OSGeo umbrella.

### FLOSSK

Free Libre Open Source Software Kosova (FLOSSK) is a non-governmental organization based in Kosovo established in 2009 in order to support, promote and develop free and open source software. FLOSSK also contributes to open and participatory knowledge, education in information technologies through open courseware, and open standards, culture and open society using free communication. Since its founding, FLOSSK has been involved in bringing the IT community closer to free and open source projects by organizing yearly conferences, workshops, meetups and actively participating in public policy development.
FLOSSK is an OSGeo and OSMF local chapter in Kosovo. -->
