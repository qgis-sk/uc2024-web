<h3>Getting there</h3>

<p>
<b>By Plane:</b> Bratislava airport (BTS) has relatively few connections. Vienna airport (VIE) is only ~50 km away and it is very well connected to many cities. There are frequent bus connections between Vienna airport and Bratislava (every 15-30 minutes, typically 45-60 minutes journey), buses arriving/leaving right in front of the airport terminal. Buses are operated by various companies (FlixBus, RegioJet, Slovak Lines) and tickets can be bought either online or from the driver). Taxis can be arranged as well (40 minutes journey, starting from 40 EUR, e.g. <a href="https://www.doprava-schwechat.sk/en/">Doprava Schwechat</a>).
</p><p>
<b>By Train/Bus:</b> Bratislava is well connected to other cities by trains and bus. Some international trains only go to Vienna, but from there there are frequent train connections to Bratislava's train stations.
</p><p>
<b>By Car:</b> Please note that the area around the venue has regulated parking on the streets (<a href="https://paas.sk/en/zone-map/">see the map</a>).
</p>

<h3>Getting around</h3>

<p>
<b>Walk</b>: The venue is in walking distance from the city center, and it is easy to explore the city on foot.
</p><p>
<b>Bus or tram</b>: The public transport has a fairly good network. Best to check your route in Google Maps, it has timetables of buses and trams. Tickets: either buy a paper ticket from a vending machine at a bus/tram stop, or use IDS BK mobile app to buy e-tickets (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.casperise.urbi.online.bid">Google Play</a> / <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ids-bk-cestujeme-jednoduch%C5%A1ie/id1360894243">App Store</a>). The basic ticket is valid for 30 minutes and costs 0.97 eur (e-tickets) / 1.10 eur (paper tickets).
</p><p>
<b>Taxi</b>: It is most convenient to use Bolt app to get a taxi (Uber works as well). It is generally not advised to use taxis waiting at the main train station, due to bad reputation of overcharging clients.
</p><p>
<b>Bike sharing</b>: There are two options for those who like to cycle - <a href="https://www.rekola.cz/en/">Rekola</a> (pink bikes) and <a href="https://slovnaftbajk.sk/en">Slovnaftbajk</a> (yellow bikes with docking stations). Please note that cycling infrastructure is not as developed as in some other European cities and often you need to use lanes shared with cars.
</p><p>
<b>E-Scooter sharing</b>: There are two companies operating scooter rentals - Bolt and Tier.
</p>
